There are a great many tutorials, case studies and questions about PCA available for study.  We have looked at many of them!  In the course of preparing this package, we have found the following resources, given in no particular order, especially useful.

Many of these are questions asked at [Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com), which form a tremendous corpus for learning.  When studying these, be sure to look at the original question, the answers, and the comments.  Some answers are more helpful than others, and the dialog can be enlightening as well.
