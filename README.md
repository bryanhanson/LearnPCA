## What is LearnPCA?

`LearnPCA` is an `R` package to help people learn about Principal component analysis (PCA), which is one of the most widely used data analysis techniques.  This package provides a series of vignettes explaining PCA starting from basic concepts. The primary purpose is to serve as a self-study resource for anyone wishing to understand PCA better. A few convenience functions are provided as well.

### Installing LearnPCA from CRAN:

````r
install.packages("LearnPCA")
````

### Installing LearnPCA from Github:

````r
install.packages("remotes")
library("remotes")
install_github(repo = "bryanhanson/LearnPCA@main")
library("LearnPCA")
````

If you use `@some_other_branch` you can download other branches that might be available.  They may or may not pass CRAN checks and thus may not install automatically using the method above.  Check the NEWS file to see what's up.

### To view the Vignettes:

````r
browseVignettes("LearnPCA")
